# SP.js - Material Design UI library

Not everyone needs a complete framework like Vuetify or Angular for little stuffs. This is just a 44kb (.min.js) and 117kb (.min.css)
This library is made with a lot of widget components. To name a few snackbar, dialog, waiting, context menu etc.

This is a lightweight library made with complete accordance with official material design principles. A lot of UI stuff can only be done with class names and data-attributes.

## Highlights
1. Basic material components like header, ripples, buttons, list, table, form etc.
2. Material color palettes
3. Javascript controlled material components with rich gestures and back key event handler (you can remove widgets by either clicking something or pressing the "back key" for rich experience).
4. DOM handler with "$" function
5. Included normalize.css
6. Many more little things which make the library beautiful

## Getting started
### Widgets
Probably the only thing you have come here for :)
#### 1. `createSnackbar()` Material design snackbars
If you are android user you probably would have noticed a 50 pixels heigh rectangular box
